  <p>ðKnowledge about the tidal currents are essential for all marine activities in the waters of the Faroe Islands, and thus also detailed tidal information. Traditional tidal information as well as booklets with tidal maps based on the knowledge of skillful local sailors has been available for a very long time. </p>
   <p>The first attempts to generate high resolution tidal charts for Faroese waters by numerical simulations were done in the early 1990'is [1], and in 1999 a simulation with a half nautical mile resolution for the entire shelf was conducted on the behalf of the oil companies exploring the Faroe area [2]. The results from this simulation served as boundary conditions for three regional models, which together covered the entire coastal areas of the Faroes with 100m resolution. This effort was mainly to assist the growing aquaculture industry [3]. </p>
    <p>The reason for splitting the area into three regions was due to limited available computer resources at that time. The result from this high resolution simulation was later utilized in a information system developed for lattops, named HÚK, which stands for Hent Útróðrar Kunning in Faroese, which may translated to useful information for coastal fishing [4]. This system consist of vector maps presenting the tidal currents in an average spring period every approximately 15 minutes in the period of the dominating M2-constiturent (12.4206 hours), e.g. does not display changes due to neap or spring tide nor seasonal variations. </p>
	 <p>This system was made available for free on a web-page, and already after the first week there was more than 1200 downloads. Despite its simplicity, the system is still widely used, and is seen onboard on numerous leisure boats, fishing vessels, work boat in the fish farming industry as well in rescue and coast guard vessels. More recently new simulations with 100m numerical resolution, but with the entire inner shelf in one area (Fig. 1), which are validated towards recent current profile measurements in four of the main straits in addition to a large number of tidal gauges [5]. </p>
	  <p>In recent years the technological development has been significant and initial tests shows that present day smart phones contains sufficient computational capacity to generate tidal current maps directly from the available data generated from the most recent tidal simulations [5] at any given time and area, which is the objective of the present proposal. Further, it is the ambition to prepare the system for inclusion of other data resulting from the research at the institute, including results from even more detailed tidal simulations currently in progress.</p>
